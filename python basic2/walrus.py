"""
The walrus operator (:=) can be particularly useful in professional Python code for improving code readability and efficiency in various scenarios. Here are some professional use cases:

    1.Loop Control and Filtering:
    
# Without walrus operator
while True:
    line = input()
    if not line:
        break
    process(line)

# With walrus operator
while line := input():
    process(line)

This simplifies the loop control structure by combining the assignment and loop condition, making the code more concise.

2. List Comprehensions:

# Without walrus operator
squares = []
for num in numbers:
    squares.append(num ** 2)

# With walrus operator
squares = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]

The walrus operator can make list comprehensions cleaner by avoiding the need for an explicit assignment statement.

3.Filtering and Mapping:

# Without walrus operator
valid_names = []
for name in names:
    if is_valid(name):
        valid_names.append(transform(name))

# With walrus operator
valid_names = [transform(name) for name in names if is_valid(name)]

In scenarios where both filtering and transformation are required, the walrus operator can help maintain readability.


4.Complex Conditions:

# Without walrus operator
if len(data) > 0 and data[0] == target:
    do_something()

# With walrus operator
if (first_item := data[0]) == target:
    do_something()

The walrus operator can help avoid redundant computations when complex conditions involve the same value.

5. String Formatting:

    # Without walrus operator
    message = "Hello, " + name + ". Your age is " + str(age) + "."

    # With walrus operator
    message = f"Hello, {name}. Your age is {age}."

    The walrus operator can help simplify string formatting by reducing the need for explicit variable assignments.

    Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+):

    Python's pattern matching feature, introduced in Python 3.10, can also benefit from the walrus operator by capturing parts of a match and using them in subsequent code.

Remember that the key is to use the walrus operator where it enhances code clarity and conciseness, without sacrificing readability. Its primary purpose is to reduce redundancy and make the code more elegant while maintaining its understandability.
