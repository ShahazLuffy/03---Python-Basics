print(10==10.0)
"""
Python's approach to this situation involves implicit type coercion, where it automatically converts one of the operands to match the type of the other operand. In this case, Python would convert the integer 10 to a floating-point number before performing the comparison. This conversion makes the two values directly comparable, and since they are equal numerically, the expression 10 == 10.0 evaluates to True.
